# Generating UI

## Setup Locally

### Prerequisites

Generating UI requires the following API keys and external services:

#### Package Manager

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

#### APIs

- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup/)
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- (optional) [Google GenAI API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- (optional) [Fireworks AI API key](https://fireworks.ai/login)
- (optional) [Groq AI API key](https://groq.com) - audio/video transcription
- (optional) [FireCrawl API key](https://firecrawl.dev) - web scraping
- (optional) [ExaSearch API key](https://exa.ai) - web search


#### Authentication

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account for authentication

#### LangGraph Server

- [LangGraph CLI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/cli/) for running the graph locally

#### LangSmith

- [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for tracing & observability

### Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-generating-ui-repository-url>
cd generating-ui
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

After installing dependencies, copy the contents of both `.env.example` files in the root of the project, and in `apps/web` into `.env` and set the required values:

```bash
# The root `.env` file will be read by the LangGraph server for the agents.
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
# The `apps/web/.env` file will be read by the frontend.
cd apps/web/
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, setup authentication with Supabase.

### Setup Authentication

After creating a Supabase account, visit your [dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects) and create a new project.

Next, navigate to the `Project Settings` page inside your project, and then to the `API` tag. Copy the `Project URL`, and `anon public` project API key. Paste them into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables in the `apps/web/.env` file.

After this, navigate to the `Authentication` page, and the `Providers` tab. Make sure `Email` is enabled (also ensure you've enabled `Confirm Email`). You may also enable `GitHub`, and/or `Google` if you'd like to use those for authentication. (see these pages for documentation on how to setup each provider: [GitHub](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github), [Google](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google))

#### Test authentication

To verify authentication works, run `yarn dev` and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This should redirect you to the [login page](http://localhost:3000/auth/login). From here, you can either login with Google or GitHub, or if you did not configure these providers, navigate to the [signup page](http://localhost:3000/auth/signup) and create a new account with an email and password. This should then redirect you to a conformation page, and after confirming your email you should be redirected to the [home page](http://localhost:3000).

### Setup LangGraph Server

The first step to running Generating UI locally is to build the application. This is because Generating UI uses a monorepo setup, and requires workspace dependencies to be built so other packages/apps can access them.

Run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
yarn build
```

Now we'll cover how to setup and run the LangGraph server locally.

Navigate to `apps/agents` and run `yarn dev` (this runs `npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev --port 54367`).

```
Ready!
- 🚀 API: http://localhost:54367
- 🎨 Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio?baseUrl=http://localhost:54367
```

After your LangGraph server is running, execute the following command inside `apps/web` to start the Generating UI frontend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

On initial load, compilation may take a little bit of time.

Then, open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and start generating UI!
